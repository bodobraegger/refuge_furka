# introduction

## QUILTS
- patchwork: using pieces of fabrics and cloths 
- historically undervalued
- practised by certain 'under-privileged' social groups
  - knowledge passed on from woman to woman
- crazy quilts

## ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
- basic mathematical background
- machines as adaptable tools, problem solvers
- link to human intelligence: the brain as the ultimate programmable tool
- based entirely on statistics
- learning: some optimization goal to formulate and grade on
  - productive failure: potentially the best way for humans to learn too!
- interesting when applied to creative tasks
- synthesizing true solutions to problems
- recognition vs creative tasks
- how original is original?
